1: Code Refactor

I created 2 versions of this website for this homework assignment. One utilizes floats (index.html and style.css).
The other utlizes bootstrap with grids (nofloat.html and nofloatstyle.css).
You may view both pages on github as I created links to each other at the bottom in each footer. 
So you can click from one to the other.

Assignmnet was primarily tested in Google Chrome web browser. However, it was also tested in the end by
Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer. It was even tested on Safari on an iPhone and looked beautiful. 

The version that utilizes bootstrap adapts very where to different screen sizes. It was almost seemless and much easier to program. The bootstrap version adjusts the sizes of it's divs without any problems, as long as the screen size is above 380px wide. In the era of HD and 4K that should not be a problem.

FOR BEST RESUALTS ON THE FLOAT VERSION OF THE WEBSITE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT, VIEW THE PAGE ON GOOGLE CHROME! FLOATS DO NOT ADJUST WELL WITH DIFFERENT SIZES! PICTURES ALWAYS OVERLAP THEIR DIV WHEN THE FLOAT VERSION IS BEING USED BY ANOTHER WEBBROWSER OTHER THAN CHROME!

Website colors were changed from Blue to Gold and Black.

To see primary changes made by student, read all comments and look at lines 214-333 in the styles.css file.

To see the version of the website built in Bootstrap with grids, see nofloat.html and nofloatstyle.css.

From my observation on this homework assignmnet, it seems like Bootstrap is a much better method for creating these type of layouts than using floats. The floats don't adapt well in all browsers and Bootstrap is just easier to use. If you open index.html up in firefox and adjust the pixel width to around 500px you will see the photos operlapping. I suppose you can make is so the image shrinks when the screen size shrinks, but that's just more work and it's bound to be broken on one of the many web browsers out there. Bootstrap is super robust in the sense that it just works on all web browsers automatically and it is easier to use. I guess people were right about floats being terrible, they just don't make any sense at all.
